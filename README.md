This algorithm generates two sets of 64-bit random numbers between -1 and 1, then trains a deep learning model using gradient descent to bring these synthetic numbers closer together linearly and reduce the error rate. It adjusts the spacing of numbers using the formula y = sqrt(X) and includes gravity between the numbers.
